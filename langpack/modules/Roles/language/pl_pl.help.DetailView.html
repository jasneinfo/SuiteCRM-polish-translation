<h1>Roles</h1>

<p>Use this page to view and set access permissions for the selected module.  

You can set permissions at the module-level or at a field-level. The page displays the role's module-level permissions. To view field level permissions, select the module from the left panel. The page refreshes to display module level permissions in the top panel and field-level permissions in the bottom panel.

<p>Set module-level permissions as follows:
<ul>
<li>In the Access column, click <span class="helpButton">Not Set</span> and select <span class="helpButton">Enabled</span> to allow access, or <span class="helpButton">Disabled</span> to hide the module.
<li>In the Access Type column, select of the following:
<ul>
<li><span class="helpButton">Not Set</span>: to ensure that the role does not affect a particular setting.
<li><span class="helpButton">Normal</span>: to grant permissions to view and manage records depending on team membership.
<li><span class="helpButton">Admin</span>: to grant permissions to view and administer all records in the module regardless of team membership.
<li><span class="helpButton">Developer</span>: to grant developer privileges for the specified module. This allows the user access to the administration and developer tools, namely Studio, Workflow Management, and Dropdown Editor. However, the user needs the appropriate team membership to view and manage records.
<li><span class="helpButton">Admin & Developer</span>: to grant developer privileges for the specified module. This allows the user access to the administration and developer tools, namely Studio, Workflow Management, and Dropdown Editor. The user does not need team membership to view and manage records.
</ul>
<li>In the Delete column, click <span class="helpButton">Not Set</span> and select one of the following:
<ul>
<li>Select <span class="helpButton">All</span> to allow any user to delete records.
<li>Select <span class="helpButton">Owner</span> to allow only record owners to delete records.
<li>Select <span class="helpButton">None</span> to prevent all users from deleting records.
</ul>
Similarly, set permissions to edit records, export records, and import records. Set permissions for ListView in the List column. Set permissions for the DetailView in the View column.

<p>To set field-level permissions, click <span class="helpButton">Not Set</span> for the desired field and select one of the following:
<ul>
<li><span class="helpButton">Read/Write</span>: Allows all users to view and edit records.
<li><span class="helpButton">Read/Owner Write</span>: Allows all users to view the records; only the record owner can edit the record.
<li><span class="helpButton">Read Only</span>:Allows all users to only view the record.
<li><span class="helpButton">Owner Read/Owner Write</span>: Allows only the record owner to read and edit the record.
<li><span class="helpButton">>None</span>: Hides the field from all users.
</ul>
A field with a plus sign (+) indicates a field group. For example, Billing Street includes the City, State, Postalcode, and Country. The permissions that you set for such a field applies to the whole group.

<p>Click <span class="helpButton">Save</span> to save your changes.
